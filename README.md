# Data counter widget

This widget performs a database count on a selected object adhering to the XPath contraints set in the modeller. The purpose of this widget is to allow developers to quickly add counters to their Mendix projects. 


## Typical usage scenario

When adding the widget to a project you have to select the object to count (and optionally add XPath constraints), a refresh rate and a microflow to trigger when clicking on the counter shown to the user.
The minimum refresh rate is set to 200 ms.
